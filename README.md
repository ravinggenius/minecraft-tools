## Development

This project is a labor of love. If you want to help (thank you!), please open an issue to coordinate work on the roadmap above.

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

While that's running, copy `.env` to `.env.local` and adjust any values you need to. Most values can be left alone, but (Postgres) `DATABASE_URL` is required. Any values not set will fall back to `.env`.

```shell
cp .env .env.local
```

Then run the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

## Production

This project is meant to be hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). See the [Next deploy page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more information.
